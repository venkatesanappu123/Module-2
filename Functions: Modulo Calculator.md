# Functions in Python: Modulo Calculator

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that defines a function which accepts two values and returns their **modulo** using the `%` operator.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a function called `result` that takes two arguments `a` and `b`.
2. Inside the function, compute the modulo using `a % b`.
3. Print the result of the modulo operation.
4. Get two integer inputs from the user.
5. Call the `result` function with the user-provided values.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
def result(a,b):
  m=a%b 
  print(f"modulo is {m}")
 
a = int(input()) 
b = int(input())
```

## Output

## Result
Thus the program that defines a function which accepts two values and returns their modulo using the % operator is executed successfully.
